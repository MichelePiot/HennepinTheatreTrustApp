## **Project Description**

The Hennepin Theatre Trust is an organization seeking to bring positive change through the arts by bringing the community together; with students being a large part of their demographic. The community currently lacks a source dedicated specifically for students' use and involvement within this organization making it easy for them to connect, collaborate, and be more involved.


<p align="center"> How could creating an app be beneficial for The Hennepin Theatre Trust to connect to their student demographic? 

An app allowing students to connect with not only the theatre community but to other students also showing interest in getting more involved. This type of app can increase student use and involvement by incorporating social media trends making it easy for students ranging in age to connect with each other.

### **Desired Outcome**

A dedicated app for students seeking ways to get more involved. 

Not only providing reliable resources such as community events and information on how to become more involved but students seeking connections or friendships would find a space dedicated to those with similar interests. 

## **Research**

User research was conducted to determine what the most important aspects are and how they relate to a student using the app.

Because Hennepin Theatre Trust already had a website for their organization, information from there was pulled, gathered, and analyzed to determine what was most suitable and useful for students. This includes anything from information on how to get involved to community meetings and events.
  
Since the **target audience** was already decided, it was essential to begin thinking like a current middle/high school student; placing our thoughts and ideas into the perspective of the target audience. Each member drew upon their own experiences and combined them with current trends to begin developing our user journey.
  

### Persona Development
  
The development of personas were fictional representations of the target community who represented the realistic major user group.

</p>

The personas for this design project are different, yet the overall goal stays the same. Both personas desire a comprehensive source for involvement and a sense of belonging to a community. Our personas share the same goal but one seeks involvement specifically within theater while the other is more curious about trying new things. This allows two different perspectives allowing a more diverse and comprehensive design. 

### Empathy Mapping
  
Empathy maps were created for each of the personas to highlight their needs, understand what drives their behaviors, and help guide a product that will benefit the users.

</p>
  
Drawn from the personas, **empathy mapping** supports the user journey in aiding users by defining key aspects of their behaviors. The user journey becomes more comprehensive and therefore the design of the product connects to each user.

### Card Sorting
  
Overall the Hennepin Theatre Trust website wasn't created solely for students and their education involvement.
  
By developing personas and identifying what drives their behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, we can begin to decipher which aspects of the website are of extreme pertinence and pull our information from there.
  
The qualitative information received gives design thinking some structure in decoding what users would value and which aspects are less important. The structure of the design comes into play by highlighting the major aspects and guaranteeing they are at the forefront of the design.

## Ideation
  
### User Flow
  
Initial user flow outlining the general path user would take to interact with key aspects of the app.

<p align="center">
  <img width="571" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 9 49 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151684793-816b54fd-2eaf-4629-86c5-0e33added5ed.png">
  </p>

### Sketches
  
Basic sketches outlining the major aspects desired to be included within the design show potential layouts and allow different design ideas to be considered specifically highlighting the homepage which will incorporate the social media feed.

<p align="center">
  <img width="611" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 9 52 40 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151684857-9590aeca-c0e5-4342-8bb5-9df2886d596f.png">
  </p>

### Wireframes
  
After initial sketches of the layout were designed, the wireframing process can begin with an informal outline showing the current layout of the app.

<p align="center">
  <img width="1585" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 9 55 08 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151684906-6029cdfc-aef6-449f-9a8b-ddaeee61f6f8.png">
  </p>

*Wireframe semantic differential test* 
  
To get feedback from users and insight about their attitudes towards the design, a **semantic differential** test was implemented on the projected initial page of the app.
  
To determine which layout was eliciting the desired emotional response, participants viewed two prototypes compared their social media feed layout.

<p aligh="center">
  <img width="834" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 9 57 29 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151684959-41377f2b-860e-4ec3-8c6b-244b51820848.png">
  </p>
  
Either positive or negative, a set of adjectives were displayed in which participants had the ability to choose which direction they felt fit each prototype. 

By doing so the design can be reevaluated without re-engineering the core functionality of the app and its design to determine if the chosen adjectives align with the intended emotional response.

<p align="center">
<img width="639" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 9 59 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151685001-99ef2fb8-3882-427b-a0e5-8f50b77dc78c.png">
  </p>

*The adjectives were specifically selected as potential descriptors of the user interface and included terms salient to the desired outcome of the design.*

The qualitative results generated from prototype 2 give some insight into how users are feeling when interacting with that design versus prototype 1. Based on the results, it became apparent that **the design layout of prototype 2 more aligned with the design goals of the project.**

## Prototyping

By prototyping these designs we can showcase the overall design concept before highlighting design visuals which helps determine if the design is linking correctly to the overall user flow and allows for redesign and time to gather feedback.

### Low Fidelity Prototype Design

The purpose of creating low-fidelity prototypes is to gain insight from our users. By doing so we can continue the conversation highlighting their needs, goals, and desires.

Below is a snapshot of the low-fidelity prototype created highlighting the initial design layout. This design will be used to enhance our user experience through testing and evaluation.

       <p align="center">

</p>

*Here, the visual design becomes less important while the layout and user flow take center stage.*


### Prototype Evaluation

#### Click-Through Prototypes

To determine if the initial design is highlighting the desired areas of importance, click-through prototypes were created to depict the elements of transition and assist in bringing the desired user flow to life.

<p align="center">
  <img width="553" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-29 at 10 10 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33335020/151685211-c744e23a-eac3-42bb-8d92-2c25b64f004a.png">
  </p>

Early visualizations of how users transition throughout the design can highlight **areas of inconsistency** or confusion and confirm users are able to reach their desired destination and goals when interacting with the product.

#### Click-Through Testing

It is essential for users to be able to navigate through the low fidelity prototype before proceeding with the design.

As we can see all of the tested participants were able to successfully navigate from the main feed to the messages page.

An easy task yet essential because if users are not able to understand where to go in the beginning stages of development, they will struggle to complete their goals during the final iteration.

## Implementation

#### Startup Screen

The startup screen for the Hennepin Theatre Trust app was something that desired to be simplistic yet allowed for users to be able to identify what the app consisted of.

 #### HomePage 

The current iteration of the app allows for a collaborative homepage showcasing pictures posted by peers within the theater community. This ties into the current social media trend and allows for greater connections and sharing between those involved in the theater community. 

<p align="center">
