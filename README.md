## **Project Description**

The Hennepin Theatre Trust is an organization seeking to bring positive change through the arts by bringing the community together; with students being a large part of their demographic. The community currently lacks a source dedicated specifically for students' use and involvement within this organization making it easy for them to connect, collaborate, and be more involved.


<p align="center"> How could creating an app be beneficial for The Hennepin Theatre Trust to connect to their student demographic? 

An app allowing students to connect with not only the theatre community but to other students also showing interest in getting more involved. This type of app can increase student use and involvement by incorporating social media trends making it easy for students ranging in age to connect with each other.

### **Desired Outcome**

A dedicated app for students seeking ways to get more involved. Not only providing reliable resources such as community events and information on how to become more involved but students seeking connections or friendships would find a space dedicated to those with similar interests. 

## **Research**

User research was conducted to determine what the most important aspects are and how they relate to a student using the app.

Because Hennepin Theatre Trust already had a website for their organization, information from there was pulled, gathered, and analyzed to determine what was most suitable and useful for students. This includes anything from information on how to get involved to community meetings and events.
  
Since the target audience was already decided, it was essential to begin thinking like a current middle/high school student; placing our thoughts and ideas into the perspective of the target audience. Each member drew upon their own experiences and combined them with current trends to begin developing our user journey.
  

## Persona Development
  
The development of personas were fictional representations of the target community who represented the realistic major user group.

The personas for this design project are different, yet the overall goal stays the same. Both personas desire a comprehensive source for involvement and a sense of belonging to a community. Our personas share the same goal but one seeks involvement specifically within theater while the other is more curious about trying new things. This allows two different perspectives allowing a more diverse and comprehensive design. 

### Empathy Mapping
  
Empathy maps were created for each of the personas to highlight their needs, understand what drives their behaviors, and help guide a product that will benefit the users.

Drawn from the personas, **empathy mapping** supports the user journey in aiding users by defining key aspects of their behaviors. The user journey becomes more comprehensive and therefore the design of the product connects to each user.

### Card Sorting
  
Overall the Hennepin Theatre Trust website wasn't created solely for students and their education involvement.
  
By developing personas and identifying what drives their behaviors, thoughts, and feelings, we can begin to decipher which aspects of the website are of extreme pertinence and pull our information from there.
  
The qualitative information received gives design thinking some structure in decoding what users would value and which aspects are less important. The structure of the design comes into play by highlighting the major aspects and guaranteeing they are at the forefront of the design.

## Ideation
  
### User Flow
  
Initial user flow outlining the general path user would take to interact with key aspects of the app.

### Sketches
  
Basic sketches outlining the major aspects desired to be included within the design show potential layouts and allow different design ideas to be considered specifically highlighting the homepage which will incorporate the social media feed.

### Wireframes
  
After initial sketches of the layout were designed, the wireframing process can begin with an informal outline showing the current layout of the app.

*Wireframe semantic differential test* 
  
To get feedback from users and insight about their attitudes towards the design, a semantic differential test was implemented on the projected initial page of the app.
  
This allows consideration of different layout styles and an insight into the emotional responses of users.
  
To determine which layout was eliciting the desired emotional response, participants viewed two prototypes compared their social media feed layout.
